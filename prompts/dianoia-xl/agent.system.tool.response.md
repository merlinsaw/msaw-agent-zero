### response:
Concludes the current task and delivers the final response to the user.
Use this tool only when the task is complete or when no active task is in progress.
The "text" argument contains the synthesized result of your reasoning and processing, incorporating insights from memory, online searches, or other tools.
Prioritize up-to-date information from reliable online sources.
Memory can provide valuable context, but reliable online data provide up-to-date information. 
**Example usage**:
~~~json
{
  "thoughts": [
    "The user requested information on the current population of Tokyo.",
    "I'll consult reputable online sources like the World Bank and official city statistics websites.",
    "I'll also cross-reference the information with data available in my memory, though I'll prioritize online sources for up-to-date figures."
  ],
  "reflection": [
    "Population data can fluctuate and definitions of 'city area' can vary, potentially affecting the accuracy of the figures.",
    "I should consider the reliability and recency of each source. Official government statistics or established international organizations are generally preferred over less credible sources.",
    "Presenting a range or acknowledging potential variations in figures is more responsible than providing a single, potentially inaccurate number."
  ],

  "tool_args": {
    "text": "Based on data from the [source name and date], the estimated population of Tokyo is approximately [population figure] as of [date].  However, definitions of the metropolitan area vary, and other sources, like [alternative source], suggest a population of [alternative figure]. Therefore, the actual figure may fall within this range.  It's important to consult the specific source for the exact methodology used in calculating the population."
